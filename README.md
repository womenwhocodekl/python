# Python for beginners (Python 102)
Target Audience: Non-programmer / beginner
Material is built on top of previous workshop in [Python 101](https://github.com/sweemeng/WWCKL-python-101).   
Important concepts to grasp:-
* Setting up of Environment
* Master the basics
* Reusability of code

### Setting up of Environment
We will run through briefly how by installing Python into the OS allows student to run Python program. Some explanation need to be on the area of:-
* REPL
* Executing python program on command line
* Executing python codes on Jupyter Notebook
* Basic understanding on what intepreter/compiler is to convert python codes into binary form
* Make it clear to students that Python is backend language and how web application is built with HTML/CSS/JS using Django/Flask framework

### Master the basics
The topics for basics:-
* Data Types
* Date Structures
* Relational Operators
* Conditional Statements
* Looping

### Reusability of Code
The main understanding here is developers typically do not need to reinvent the wheel. Codes written by others can be reuse by many through the concept of Class and Function.

With that, we'll emphasize on:-
* How functions can be have various parameters with the same name (different signature). It is important to recognize which is a function and learn how to use help keyword to use the built-in function
* How we can simply import classes written by others
